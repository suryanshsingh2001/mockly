Mockly is an open-source tool that allows developers to create professional-looking screenshots and mockups with ease. With Mockly, you can pick, place, and zoom—done. It's designed for fast, stress-free mockups for developers who'd rather code than design.



## ✨ Features

1. **Instant Mockups**: Upload, tweak, done. It's like magic, but without the wand.
2. **Multi-device Preview**: Instantly see how your designs look on any screen size—because nobody has time for resizing.
   - **Example**: Select "Screen Size" dropdown menu to automatically generate views for mobile, tablet, and desktop versions.
3. **Zoom & Place**: Precisely position your screenshot, and zoom in or out like a pro—minus the struggle.
   - **Example**: Drag your cursor to specify the position and use the zoom slider in the "Design" tab as needed.
4. **Text & Style**: Add text, pick your style, and make it pop. Because plain screenshots are so last year.
   - **Example**: Enter your text under the "Text" tab. Adjust the font size, weight, color, and drag it with around to align it your mockup.
5. **No Login Required**: Start creating immediately without any sign-up process.
6. **No Watermarks**: Your designs, your brand—no unwanted additions.
7. **Free to Use**: Powerful features accessible to everyone at no cost.
