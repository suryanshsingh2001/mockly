## About the Project

Mockly is a developer-friendly tool designed to make creating screenshots and mockups incredibly easy. Whether you need a quick visual for your project or a polished mockup for presentations, Mockly lets you do it all without the complexity of design tools like Figma or Canva.

The goal? To give developers a simple, fast, and powerful way to create professional-looking screenshots without needing to dive into design-heavy workflows.

## Inspiration

As a developer, Iâ€™ve often found myself frustrated with how much effort it takes to produce something as simple as a screenshot or mockup. Why spend 30 minutes in a design tool for something that should take 5?

Thatâ€™s why I built **Mockly**â€”a lightweight, no-frills tool for developers who would rather focus on code than design. This is my first attempt at building something like this, and Iâ€™d love to iterate on it and make it even better with community input.

## Features

### 1. **Instant Mockups**
Upload an image, customize it, and you're done in minutes. Mockly keeps it simple while still offering flexibility.

### 2. **Advanced Design Controls**
Customize your screenshots with intuitive design tools like:
- **Zoom & Place**: Easily position your screenshot and zoom in or out to highlight the details you want.
- **Border Radius**: Add rounded corners for a sleek, modern look.
- **Shadows & Transparency**: Play with shadow effects and transparency to give your designs depth and style.
- **Backgrounds**: Choose from solid colors, gradient backgrounds, or upload custom images to set the perfect scene for your screenshot.

### 3. **Text Customization**
Add and style text with ease using:
- **Font Size & Color**: Pick your font, adjust the size, and choose colors that match your brand or style.
- **Text Placement**: Move your text around and align it perfectly with your mockup.

### 4. **Multi-Device Preview**
Instantly see how your designs will look across different screen sizes, including:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

### 5. **Export**
Once your design is ready, export it in high resolution, ready to be shared, used in presentations, or sent out for feedback. 

## Tech Stack

Mockly is built with modern tools to keep things fast and smooth:
- **Next.js**: The backbone of the app, handling server-side rendering and performance optimizations.
- **HTML Canvas**: At the core of the design features, HTML Canvas powers the manipulation of images, text, and other visual elements.
- **Shadcn**: For styling components and giving Mockly a polished, cohesive look.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

This is just the first step! Iâ€™m planning to make **Mockly** open-source soon, so anyone can contribute and help make it even better. Whether it's adding more customization options, improving the user interface, or introducing new features, Iâ€™d love to collaborate with the developer community.

Your feedback is invaluableâ€”if you've got ideas for how to make Mockly better, drop a comment or reach out. Letâ€™s make this tool the go-to for quick, no-hassle mockups.
